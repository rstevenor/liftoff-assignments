# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our group is going to create a application that will show ratings for books, movies, hotels, and restaurants. This app will have a social aspect that will allow users to connect with their friends and see their ratings, giving priority to their reviews over the reviews of others. 

### Features
-Create Account/Login Capabilities
-Review Rating system - Prioritizing trust reviewers
-Ability to connect/follow fellow users
-Profile View for Each User 
-'What are you looking for' search feature, allowing results to be tailor filtered to user's needs
-Review Display with profile images and a interest box to display user's interests
-Tagging System

### Technologies
Backend Java, likely with a persistent SQL database for storing (I believe this could change as our application grows, I believe we should build with growth in mind and SQL might have unexpected limitations)  
Front-End HTML & CSS with potential JavaScript Elemenets
Would love to consider either Angular or React for client side display. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'd like to use Spring Security for our application, while we have used Spring Boot extensively, I'd like to dive into the security aspect more. I'd also like to implement Facebook and Google logins, potentially providing a way to link with current Facebook friends on our application. As I stated in technologies, I also believe it would be worth while to investigate another form of database to make our project scalable at a higher level. I am concerned about loadtimes when it comes to the social aspect of application, I'm unsure if SQL is the right database for storing friend connections. I'd like to learn more about how to implement this social aspect withtout causing undue stress on our servers. I also believe learning to implement Angular or React with a java backend would be deeply rewarding.
